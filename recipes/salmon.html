        <h1>Crispy-Skinned Orange Honey Salmon</h1>
        <img src="salmon.jpg" alt="A picture depicting a pair of nicely cooked salmons">
        <p>Fresh, Asian-inspired salmon fillets with a crispy skin and an orange, ginger, and honey glaze. Unlike most similar recipes, this one is made without soy sauce and with totally fresh ingredients. The result is a bright, fresh fish with great taste and texture. The fresh ingredients are the star here: Don't substitute with dried, powdered, or frozen ingredients! I served on top of rice and steamed broccoli garnished with green onions. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup freshly squeezed orange juice.</li>
            <li>¼ cup honey.</li>
            <li>¼ cup rice vinegar.</li>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil.</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced.</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons grated fresh ginger.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds.</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>4 skin-on salmon fillets.</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine orange juice, honey, vinegar, olive oil, garlic, ginger, sesame seeds, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Add salmon. Seal and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Place a large cast iron skillet in the oven. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Carefully remove skillet from oven when it just barely starts to smoke. Add vegetable oil and place salmon fillets, skin-side down, in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the hot oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, or to your desired doneness, 5 to 9 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
